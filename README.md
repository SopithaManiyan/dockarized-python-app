## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-analysis.git
cd order-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, execute the `mainfile.py` script:

```bash
python mainfile.py
```

This script will:
1. Load the data from the `orders.csv` file.
2. Convert order dates to datetime format.
3. Calculate revenue for each order.
4. Perform various analyses (revenue by month, product, and customer).
5. Print the results.

## Modules

### data_processing.py

This module contains functions for data processing:

- **convert_order_dates(df)**: Converts the 'order_date' column to datetime format and ensures dates are within a valid range.
  - This function checks if the 'order_date' column is present in the DataFrame and attempts to convert its values to datetime format. It also checks if the dates fall within a sensible range (1900-2100) to avoid invalid date entries.

- **calculate_revenue(df)**: Calculates the revenue for each order based on product price and quantity.
  - This function ensures that both 'product_price' and 'quantity' columns are present in the DataFrame. It then computes the revenue for each order by multiplying the product price by the quantity ordered.

### analysis.py

This module contains functions for performing various analyses:

- **check_required_columns(df, required_columns)**: Checks if all required columns are present in the DataFrame.
  - This function ensures that all necessary columns for analysis are present in the DataFrame. If any required columns are missing, it raises an error.

- **get_revenue_by_month(df)**: Groups the data by month and calculates total revenue.
  - This function adds a 'month' column to the DataFrame by extracting the month from the 'order_date' column. It then groups the data by this 'month' column and sums the 'revenue' for each month.

- **get_revenue_by_product(df)**: Groups the data by product and calculates total revenue.
  - This function groups the data by 'product_id' and sums the 'revenue' for each product, providing insight into which products generate the most revenue.

- **get_revenue_by_customer(df)**: Groups the data by customer and calculates total revenue.
  - This function groups the data by 'customer_id' and sums the 'revenue' for each customer, identifying the top revenue-generating customers.

- **get_top_customers(df, top_n=10, revenue_by_customer=None)**: Identifies the top N customers by revenue.
  - This function either uses an existing revenue-by-customer DataFrame or calculates it on the fly. It then sorts the customers by revenue (and customer ID as a tie-breaker) to find the top N customers.

### mainfile.py

The main script to run the analysis. It loads the data, processes it, performs analyses, and prints the results.

- The `mainfile.py` script is the central orchestrator. It follows these steps:
  1. Loads the data from a CSV file using a utility function.
  2. Ensures that all required columns are present.
  3. Converts the 'order_date' column to datetime format.
  4. Calculates the revenue for each order.
  5. Performs various analyses, including revenue by month, product, and customer.
  6. Identifies the top customers by revenue.
  7. Prints the results of these analyses.

### utils.py

This module contains utility functions such as data loading functions or any other helpers that might be added in the future.

- **load_data(file_path)**: Loads data from a CSV file.
  - This function reads a CSV file from the specified file path and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.

## Testing

Tests are provided to ensure the correctness of data processing and analysis functions. To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

Tests are located in the following files:

- `test_analysis.py`
- `test_data_processing.py`
- `test_main.py`

## Docker

A Dockerfile is included to facilitate containerization of the application.

### Dockerfile

- **Base Image**: Uses an official Python runtime (python:3.11-slim) as a parent image.
- **Working Directory**: Sets the working directory in the container to /app.
- **Copy Files**: Copies the current directory contents into the container at /app.
- **Install Dependencies**: Installs the required packages specified in requirements.txt.
- **Run Application**: Runs `mainfile.py` when the container launches.

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t order-analysis .
```

To run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm order-analysis
```

### Dockerfile.test

- Similar to the main Dockerfile, but intended for running tests.
- Uses an official Python runtime (python:3.11-slim) as a parent image.
- Sets the working directory in the container to /app.
- Copies the current directory contents into the container at /app.
- Installs the required packages specified in requirements.txt.
- Runs tests using unittest when the container launches.

### docker-compose.yml

Defines services for the application:

- **app**: Builds the application using the Dockerfile and runs it in a container named `my_python_app_container`.
- **test**: Builds the test environment using Dockerfile.test and runs tests in a container named `my_python_test_container`.

To build the Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

To run the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the repository, detailing how to install, use, test, and deploy the application using Docker.
