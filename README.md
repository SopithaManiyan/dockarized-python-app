## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-analysis.git
cd order-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, execute the `mainfile.py` script:

```bash
python mainfile.py
```

This script will:

1. Load the data from the `orders.csv` file.
2. Convert order dates to datetime format.
3. Calculate revenue for each order.
4. Perform various analyses (revenue by month, product, and customer).
5. Print the results.

## Modules

### data_processing.py

Contains functions for data processing:

- `convert_order_dates(df)`: Converts the 'order_date' column to datetime format and ensures dates are within a valid range.
- `calculate_revenue(df)`: Calculates the revenue for each order based on product price and quantity.

### analysis.py

Contains functions for performing analyses:

- `check_required_columns(df, required_columns)`: Checks if all required columns are present in the DataFrame.
- `get_revenue_by_month(df)`: Calculates total revenue by month.
- `get_revenue_by_product(df)`: Calculates total revenue by product.
- `get_revenue_by_customer(df)`: Calculates total revenue by customer.
- `get_top_customers(df, top_n=10, revenue_by_customer=None)`: Identifies the top N customers by revenue.

### mainfile.py

The main script to run the analysis. It loads the data, processes it, performs analyses, and prints the results.

### utils.py

Contains utility functions such as data loading functions or any other helpers:

- `load_data(file_path)`: Loads data from a CSV file.

## Testing

Tests are provided to ensure the correctness of data processing and analysis functions. To run the tests, use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

Tests are located in the following files:

- `test_analysis.py`
- `test_data_processing.py`
- `test_main.py`

## Docker

Dockerfiles are included to facilitate containerization of the application and running tests.

### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run mainfile.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "mainfile.py"]
```

### Dockerfile.test

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "-m", "unittest", "discover"]
```

### Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to build and run the Docker containers.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: my_python_app_container

  test:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.test
    container_name: my_python_test_container
```

To build and run the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
